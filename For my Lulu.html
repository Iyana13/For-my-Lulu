						I dont know how to start with this to be honest lmao.But before i get into the things i wanna say to you i just wanna say,i know we arent able to spend today together and that kinda makes me feels bad.So i thought since I'm not able to express my love to the loml,that why not through a few words.</p>	
						<p align="centre">
						My heart, i wanna start this off by telling you that I LOVE YOU!!!.I dont want to ever stop saying those 3 words, because i really do mean it and I'm in place now where i can't imagine not being able to say those words to you.You are so special bro,and i know you're probably reading this rn on some "his lying" but baby like you're so amazing.Like Imagine being as sexy,beautiful,smart,funny(sometimes in a life)as you are.I dont know why you wouldnt think that you are and when you don't well I'll be here to remind you.<b>I'll always be here to remind you.Ngiyak'thanda Lungile Gama<b>
